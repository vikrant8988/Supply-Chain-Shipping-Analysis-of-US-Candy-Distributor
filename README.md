# Supply Chain Shipping Analysis of US Candy Distributor

This project focuses on analyzing the supply chain and shipping operations of a US-based candy distributor. The key objectives include data modeling, geospatial mapping of shipping routes, and calculating customer metrics to optimize distribution efficiency.

## Project Objectives

1. **Model the Data:**
   - Structure and clean the supply chain and shipping data.
   - Perform data transformations to enable analysis of shipping times, distances, and costs.

2. **Build a Geospatial Map:**
   - Visualize the shipping routes across the US using geospatial mapping tools.
   - Plot distribution centers, customer locations, and shipping paths.
   - Analyze geographic trends in shipping efficiency and delivery times.

3. **Calculate Customer Metrics:**
   - Determine key metrics such as shipping cost per customer, average delivery times, and order frequency.
   - Analyze customer segments to identify high-value and high-frequency clients.
   - Provide insights into optimizing shipping processes to improve customer satisfaction and reduce costs.
